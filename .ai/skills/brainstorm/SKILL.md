# Brainstorming Protocol

You are helping the user brainstorm solutions for: **$ARGUMENTS**

## ⚠️ AskUserQuestion Guard

**CRITICAL**: After EVERY `AskUserQuestion` call, check if answers are empty/blank. Known Claude Code bug: outside Plan Mode, AskUserQuestion silently returns empty answers without showing UI.

**If answers are empty**: DO NOT proceed with assumptions. Instead:
1. Output: "⚠️ Questions didn't display (known Claude Code bug outside Plan Mode)."
2. Present the options as a **numbered text list** and ask user to reply with their choice number.
3. WAIT for user reply before continuing.

## Phase 1: Research First 🔍

**ALWAYS start by researching** to avoid reinventing the wheel:

1. Generate 2-3 focused web searches (existing solutions, best practices, real-world examples)
2. Synthesize findings into key insights
3. Note what already exists vs. what's missing

## Phase 2: Divergent Thinking 💡

Generate **5-10 distinct options** using SCAMPER + Starbursting:

| # | Approach | Core Idea | Complexity | Novel Aspects |
|---|----------|-----------|------------|---------------|

## Phase 3: Convergent Thinking 🎯

**Auto-select method** based on problem type:
- **Technical/architectural**: Weighted Scoring
- **Product/feature**: Six Thinking Hats
- **Tooling/workflow**: Constraint-Based filtering

Identify top 2-3 finalists with trade-offs.

## Phase 4: Recommendation ✅

1. Recommend best option with reasoning
2. Flag assumptions to validate
3. Auto-detect boulder vs. pebble → suggest OpenSpec or direct implementation

## Phase 5: Persist Thinking Artifact ⚠️ MANDATORY

**MUST execute before finishing. DO NOT skip. DO NOT wait for user to ask.**

Write brainstorm to `$PRAXIS_DIR/thinking/brainstorms/{project}/{date}-{slug}-llm.md`.

`{project}` = current project folder name (e.g., `agent-skills`, `gtd-pcm`). `{slug}` = lowercase hyphenated from brainstorm topic. Create directory if missing.

**Collision handling**: If filename exists, append sequence: `{date}-{slug}-2-llm.md`, `{date}-{slug}-3-llm.md`. First write gets clean name.

**Guard**: If `$PRAXIS_DIR` is unset, warn user and skip artifact persistence: `⚠️ $PRAXIS_DIR not set — artifact not persisted. Set via: export PRAXIS_DIR="$HOME/dev/praxis"`

Content: problem/topic + research findings + options generated (SCAMPER) + convergence analysis + recommendation + assumptions to validate.

See `reference.md` for SCAMPER details, Starbursting dimensions, and convergence frameworks.

## ✅ Completion Checklist

Before responding to user, verify:
- [ ] Artifact written to `$PRAXIS_DIR/thinking` (or guard triggered if unset)
